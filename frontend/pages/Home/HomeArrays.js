It gave me an idea of what to expect in a real exam and how to effectively deal with time management. Dr. Ebtisam is kind, super supportive and was always there to clear all my doubts. Thanks a lot Dr. Ebtisam for all the help. I recommend this course to all ORE aspirants.",

The hands-on experience with skilled OSCEs and the use of the ME manikin were both incredibly helpful in improving my technique and confidence. The online revision lectures were comprehensive and easy to follow. Dr. Ebtisam and her team provided helpful predictions and support pre-exam, ensuring I focused on the most critical areas. Overall, this course exceeded my expectations and greatly contributed to my success in the exam.",

Dr Ebtissam is extremely helpful. I would not have been able to practice for manikin before the exam had it not been for her generosity and understanding. The mocks are very well made and professional, I recommend taking them 100% as they gave me a lot of confidence going into the exam.",

In regards to the manikin part of the course there‚Äôs always a very efficient and fast response for the preps which help improve your skills. Regarding the theory you are provided with all the needed materials which are very reliable and also they teach the right way to approach it. I personally would recommend this course 100% for the ORE part 2 exam.",
