While the dental subjects you need to revise for both exams are the same, the focus and scope of each exam vary slightly:
    
    <strong><u>ORE Preparation:</u></strong> To excel in the ORE exam, you will need to cover both basic science subjects and clinical dental subjects. This means your preparation will encompass a broad range of topics, including subjects like anatomy, pathology, pharmacology, dental materials, and more. The ORE exam evaluates your knowledge and skills across various areas of dentistry, ensuring you have a comprehensive understanding of the field.
    
    <strong><u>LDS Preparation:</u></strong> On the other hand, LDS exam preparation places a greater emphasis on clinical dental subjects. While the core dental subjects remain the same, LDS specifically focuses on evaluating your knowledge and competence in clinical aspects of dentistry. Notably, you won’t need to study physiology or embryology when preparing for LDS1, as these topics are not included in the exam</div>}, {'question': <a>Do I need to enrol onto a preparatory course for ORE1 or LDS1?</a>, 'answer': <div className="faq-ans" data-tab="11" role="region">While many students opt for self-study, we know the secret to skyrocketing your success lies in our preparatory course.
